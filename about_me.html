                <br>
                <p><b>Jamie Lee</b> is a first-year Masters student at the University of Michigan School of Information (expected to graduate in May 2022). She is currently pursuing her Masters of Science in Information, with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction and UX Research and Design. Throughout her graduate studies, Jamie hopes to not only explore how technology can affirm social, political, and cultural norms, but also how it can be used to challenge existing beliefs and spark reflection on the world we live in.</p>
                <p>Prior to pursuing her graduate degree, Jamie worked as a data engineer for two years at J.P. Morgan Chase, where she led various data migration and data cleansing projects to support advanced analytical work. In addition to her full-time role, she served as the Software Engineering Program Committee Lead for Manhattan, working to build community among entry-level technologists and create networking and learning opportunities with firmwide leaders. Having joined the firm through a diversity initiative called Tech Connect, Jamie was also actively involved in efforts to recruit underrepresented and non-traditional talent, making the field of technology more accessible to those of all backgrounds and identities.</p>
                <p>Jamie received her B.A. in Cognitive Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2018.</p>
