            <h1>Project Background</h1>
            <p>This team project was completed as part of a course requirement for my degree. Based on preference, our team was matched with a non-profit client called Winning Futures and over the course of the semester, we applied qualitative methodologies to identify the client’s pain points and make appropriate recommendations.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Winning Futures faced several challenges, in order of decreasing priority:</p>
            <br>
            <p>1. Recruiting and retaining business mentors in the metro Detroit area</p>
            <br>
            <p>2. Establishing business and foundation partners</p>
            <br>
            <p>3. Communicating the program’s curriculum to students and families</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>About Winning Futures</h2>
            <p>Winning Futures is a non-profit organization, based out of Warren, Michigan, that is committed to helping high school students succeed academically and professionally. Founded in 1994, the organization partners with local schools and business mentors throughout metro Detroit, to deliver a hands-on development program that support students in academic goal-setting, career exploration, and skill building.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Project Goal</h2>
            <p>The client wanted to better understand the effectiveness of their current online communications strategy in identifying, informing, and engaging those who support their mission. Our team was expected to share findings gathered through interviewing various stakeholders, and provide actionable feedback that could be used to improve the user experience.</p>
